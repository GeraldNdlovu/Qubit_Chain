# QubitChain

Qubit Chain is a permissionless distributed ledger system based on the MultiChain protocol, which is an open-source platform for private blockchains. MultiChain offers a rich set of features, including extensive configurability, rapid deployment, permissions management, native assets, and data streams. Qubit Chain is designed to enable private blockchains while providing maximal compatibility with the Bitcoin ecosystem, including the peer-to-peer protocol, transaction/block formats, and Bitcoin Core APIs/runtime parameters.

## System Requirements

These compilation instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 x64 (Xenial) and Ubuntu 18.04 x64 (Bionic) only.

C++ compilers are memory-hungry, so it is recommended to have at least 1 GB of memory available when compiling MultiChain. With less memory, compilation may take much longer due to swapfile thrashing.

## Linux Build Notes (on Ubuntu 16.04 x64 or later)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config git
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get install libevent-dev
```

### Clone MultiChain

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MultiChain/multichain.git
```

### Prepare to Download or Build V8

```bash
cd multichain
MULTICHAIN_HOME=$(pwd)
mkdir v8build
cd v8build
```

You can use pre-built headers and binaries of Google's V8 JavaScript engine by downloading and expanding [linux-v8.tar.gz](https://github.com/MultiChain/multichain-binaries/raw/master/linux-v8.tar.gz) in the current directory. If, on the other hand, you prefer to build the V8 component yourself, please follow the instructions in [V8.md](/V8.md/).

### Compile MultiChain for Ubuntu (64-bit)

```bash
cd $MULTICHAIN_HOME
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```

**Notes:**
- This will build `multichaind`, `multichain-cli`, and `multichain-util` in the `src` directory.
- The release is built with GCC after which `strip multichaind` strings the debug symbols, which reduces the executable size by about 90%.

## Windows Build Notes

Please see the instructions in [win.md](/win.md/) to build MultiChain for use with Windows.

## Mac Build Notes (on MacOS Sierra)

Please see the instructions in [mac.md](/mac.md/) to build MultiChain for use with MacOS.
